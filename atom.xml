    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m really into making terrible blog post titles. Luckily, I don&#8217;t care if you feel anything but amused.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m from a Drupal/Wordpress background, so when I was asked to create a site that would preferably not require maintenance of a server and was presented with Jekyll, I was excited, but underestimated my database addiction, by a lot.</p>

<p>I created this blog as a venting of my frustrations and a written expression of the bizarre happy dance I do when I finally get things right. Overall I would describe my experience as both perplexing and satisfying, the yin and yang of what MAW would call LEARNIN&#8217;. Chances are, this blog will pose more questions than answers, so I can&#8217;t understand why anyone would want to read this, but who knows. Maybe if only to satisfy the frustrations of other n00bs looking for comfort, ie &#8220;dude, I totally get you&#8221; or &#8220;dude, you&#8217;re fucking crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ta-da.</p>
