![Rachel Cantor][profile]

I am a 29 year old software engineer, specializing in the front end of the web. I am seeking an opportunity to further my exploration of what one can do with creative applications of the web. I am seeking something full time, at a company where experimentation is encouraged, and work-life balance is valued. 

I am originally from Buffalo, New York. In my free time I enjoy going to stand up comedy shows, eating delicious foods, and perusing all of the cultural wealth New York City has to offer.

###About this site

I am a big fan of [Polymer][1] and have built this site using web components with a significant nod to [Google's Material Design][2]. It is hosted on [Github Pages][3] using [Jekyll][4].

I've made every effort for making this website accessible too. Try using your arrow keys to navigate!

Feel free to checkout [my source code][5].
