![Rachel Cantor][profile]

True story: My first website was a beanie babies fan page at age 11, and my first internship was at an advertising agency at 13 where I created Flash sites. Over the years, I'd always been a front end hobbyist, but after I'd left working in Comedy and later, a prestigious art gallery as an Archivist, I returned to my original love of web development.

I am originally from Buffalo, New York. In my free time I enjoy going to stand up comedy shows, eating delicious foods, and perusing all of the cultural wealth New York City has to offer.

### About this site

I am a big fan of [Polymer][1] and have built this site using web components with a significant nod to [Google's Material Design][2]. It is hosted on [Github Pages][3] using [Jekyll][4].

I've made every effort for making this website accessible too. Try using your space bar to navigate!

Feel free to checkout [my source code][5].
