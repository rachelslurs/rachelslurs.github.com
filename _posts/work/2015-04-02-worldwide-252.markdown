 - Chrome packaged web app
 - Javascript state machine communicates with RFID readers using HTTP

Before the museum, I worked on the World Wide Groupâ€™s high tech sales office. I created a Chrome packaged app that responded to two RFID readers to change the views on an 80 inch 4k screen. The main challenges here were the animations as well. Since it was a webview on a pixel dense screen, the paint issues required significant troubleshooting, but ultimately, it ended up being a very elegant solution and paired nicely with an extravagant rotating 12 foot model of the building, that responded to the RFID readers as well.
