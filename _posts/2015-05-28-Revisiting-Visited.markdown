> Unstyled :visited links hav long been a pet peeve of mine, especially in other portfolios. Every time I browse one, I end up returning to a project several times before finally exiting in frustration, and unfairly blaming the designer responsible. My portfolio, I decided, wouldnâ€™t anger its visitors at my expense.
