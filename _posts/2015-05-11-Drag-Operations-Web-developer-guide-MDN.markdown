[Drag Operations - Web developer guide | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Drag_operations)

> Within a web page, there are certain cases where a default drag behavior is used. These include text selections, images, and links. When an image or link is dragged, the URL of the image or link is set as the drag data, and a drag begins. For other elements, they must be part of a selection in order for a default drag to occur. To see this in effect, select an area of a web page, and then click and hold the mouse and drag the selection. An OS-specific rendering of the selection will appear and follow the mouse pointer as the drag occurs. However, this behavior is only the default drag behavior, if no listeners adjust the data to be dragged.
