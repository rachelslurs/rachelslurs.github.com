##Projects

###Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the US Senate
*Interactive Museum*

 - Single page web apps
 - Built with SASS, Grunt, AngularJS, Ractive.js, and vanilla JS
 - Used both standard AJAX and web sockets for cross platform communication

My favorite project was the museum which opened this year in March, which was part of Edward Kennedy’s vision for a museum to teach children about the United States Senate in an exciting and immersive way. I worked onsite in the month prior to the opening and was amazed at how empty the building appeared without our tech, with the exception of the impeccably ornate replica of the Senate chamber. The entire museum is web based: from the Android tablets each visitor uses to interact with the museum, to the enormous projections on the wall that make up most of the museum’s exhibits.

###World Wide Group
*High Tech Sales Office*

 - Chrome packaged web app
 - Javascript state machine communicates with RFID readers using HTTP

Before the museum, I worked on the World Wide Group’s high tech sales office. I created a Chrome packaged app that responded to two RFID readers to change the views on an 80 inch 4k screen. The main challenges here were the animations as well. Since it was a webview on a pixel dense screen, the paint issues required significant troubleshooting, but ultimately, it ended up being a very elegant solution and paired nicely with an extravagant rotating 12 foot model of the building, that responded to the RFID readers as well.

###Company Website

 - Jekyll, static site generator
 - Built with LESS and jQuery
 - Builds from Github Pages to AWS S3 bucket using a Jenkins job
 - Custom Wordpress theme using Twitter Bootstrap

Prior to my time on the R&D team, I was the sole developer for Control Group’s marketing team. I built the company website from the ground up using Jekyll with a staging site on Github, while using a Jenkins job to push to an S3 bucket, resulting in exceptionally fast page load speeds. I built the company blog using Wordpress, developing a theme based on Twitter Bootstrap.

###Productivity Boost Using Google Apps Script

 - Google Apps Script
 - Integrates with Zendesk API

Since the marketing team was small at the time, I developed an app for fielding incoming requests for work related to the website, blog, asset management, and other various tasks. I used Google Apps Script (which essentially is modified Javascript with heightened access to Google products) to create a form that stored results in a spreadsheet, and automatically emailed reminders to my team. The productivity boost was significant and even more important, it didn’t require extensive upkeep to the codebase.

I later expanded my script for use with Zendesk and open sourced it. My blog post was featured on Zendesk’s website as a featured community tip. The app integrated Zendesk and Google Spreadsheets without the need for coding knowledge, and automated email notifications based on Zendesk due date fields.

###Branding Continuity and Marketing Drive

More on the marketing front, I exhaustively applied style guides to a myriad of documents for both internal and external use after surveying dozens of use cases spanning business development, product development, and enterprise services. I established a company-wide archive of marketing materials along with guides and structure which encouraged wide adoption across departments while maintaining organization using Google Drive.
